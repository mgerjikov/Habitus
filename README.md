# Habitus

<p><b> Habit Tracker App - project from Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program in Udacity </b></p>

The goal is to design and create the structure of a <b>Habit Tracking app</b> which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

 - Creating a SQLite table in your app
 - Populating that table with new entries
 - Modifying the entries
 - Displaying the contents of the table to users.

 #  PROJECT SPECIFICATION Habit Tracker
 
 <p><b> CRITERIA / MEETS SPECIFICATIONS </b></p>
 
 <p><b>Layout</b></p> 
 
 <p><b>Overall Layout</b> / No UI is required for this project.</p>
 
 <p><b>Functionality</b></p>
 
<p><b>Compile time Errors</b> / The code compiles without errors.</p>

<p><b>Table Definition</b> / There exists a contract class that defines name of table and constants. Inside the contract class, there is an inner class for each table created.
</p>
<p><b>Table Creation</b> / There exists a subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper that overrides onCreate() and onUpgrade().
</p>
<p><b>Data Insertion</b> / There is a single insert method that adds at least two values of two different datatypes (e.g. INTEGER, STRING) into the database using a ContentValues object and the insert() method.
</p>
<p><b>Data Reading</b> / There is a single read method that returns a Cursor object. It should get the data repository in read and use the query() method to retrieve at least one column of data.
</p>
<p><b>External Libraries and Packages </b>/ No external libraries (e.g. Realm) are used for the database code, and no Content Providers is used. All data insertion and reading should be done using direct method calls to the SQLite database in the SQLiteOpenHelper class.
 </p>
<p><b>Code Readability</b></p>
 
<p><b>Readability </b>/ Code is easily readable such that a fellow programmer can understand the purpose of the app.
</p>
<p><b>Naming conventions </b>/ All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
</p>
<p><b>Format </b>/ The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code. The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
 </p>
